This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **Population by municipality - Statistics Denmark** on **Health Care expenditures by municipality - Statistics Denmark** and show that health care expenditure correlates positively with share of inhabitants of 60 years or older.
3. Model project. We model bequest motives in an OLG-model, where we show the addition of a bequest motive significantly increases the capital and lifetime utility, while taxing bequests dampens the utility.
