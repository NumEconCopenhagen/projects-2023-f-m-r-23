# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Overlapping Generations with bequest motives** and is about how inclusion of a bequest motive and eventually a tax on bequests affect the steady-state in an OLG model, we then analysis the resulting changes in capital stock and welfare, in which we also focus on the heterogeneity between generations.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
